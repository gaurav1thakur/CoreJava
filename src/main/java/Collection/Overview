Collections Framework in Java :

  Collection is used for store
  Below are the classes which are implementing these interfaces

Set : Duplicate Not allowed
  Hash Set  -> It will not maintain the insertion order
  Linked Hash Set  -> It will maintain the insertion order
  Tree Set -> It will maintain the Ascending order

List :  Duplicates are allowed
  ArrayList -> It will maintain the insertion order with duplicate values
  Searching - Fast &  Insertion, Deletion - Slow

  LinkedList -> It will maintain the insertion order with duplicate values
  Searching - Slow  & Insertion, Deletion - Fast


Map : Key, Value Pair https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-treemap-hashmap-linkedhashmap-java/
  HashMap -> Ordering of the keys is essentially arbitrary (any ordering)
  LinkedHashMap -> Keys are ordered by their insertion order
  Treemap -> // Keys are in sorted order
